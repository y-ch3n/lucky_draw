Lucky Draw System

Welcome to my Lucky Draw System.
There are few steps to kick start the application:
1. Clone the project to your local
2. Setup your environment (.env file)
3. Run `php artisan migrate --seed`
4. Login with the email, `admin@test.com` and password, `password`

Only 4 steps then you are good to go! 

Hope you enjoy the system! Thank you!
